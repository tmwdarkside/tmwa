-- Wedding System (In Progress!)
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
-System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> Minimum System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
-800Mhz Processor
-256MB RAM
-
-NOTE: For this setup, it's recommended to not load as many maps
-and spawn as many monsters as it comes default with eAthena.
-To do this, comment off unused maps and control monster spawn
-rate using mob_count in battle_athena.conf.
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> Recommended System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------
-1+Ghz Processor
-512+MB RAM
-
-NOTE: For this setup, generally, running the eAthena default
-should be fine. If you have alot of extra RAM, you might even
-consider raising the mob_count in battle_athena.conf so that
-there will be more than normal monsters in your server
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
-Setting up eAthena
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> Setting up a new eAthena
---------------------------------------------------------------
-1. Run the setupwizard program. This will assist you in
-   configuring Athena for the first time. Just follow the
-   instructions in the program.
-2. Edit motd.txt, grf-files.txt & .conf files as neccessary
-3. If you want to add a user, go to tools and use the AddUser
-   tool
-4. Run the login-server, char-server and map-server in the
-   main Athena directory
-5. You're done!
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
-> Upgrading from older eAthena:
---------------------------------------------------------------
-- From a release newer than 953 or 817:
-1. Transfer your old /save/ folder contents (Athena.txt,
-   Account.txt, Storage.txt, etc.) to the new /safe/ folder
-2. Transfer/Edit grf-files.txt, gm-account.txt and motd.txt as
-   neccessary
-3. Transfer any extra custom NPCs to the /npc/ folder and
-   edit if neccessary
-4. Edit .conf files to setup your server
-5. You're done!
-
-NOTE: It is not recommended to transfer your DB files
-as the DB files are constantly updated by the eAthena/jAthena
-team. Just read your changes to the new DB files instead of
-replacing the new DB file with your old one.
---------------------------------------------------------------
-- From a release older than 670:
-1. Transfer your old data files (Athena.txt, Account.txt, 
-   Storage.txt, Pet.txt, etc) into the /save/ folder
-2. Transfer/Edit grf-files.txt, gm-account.txt as neccessary
-3. Transfer any extra custom NPCs/DBs to the new /npc/ folder
-   and edit if neccessary
-4. Edit .conf files to setup your server
-5. You're done!
-
-NOTE: It is not recommended to transfer your .conf files from
-your old eAthena setup to this new one because there are always
-changes and new additions to these .conf files all the time
-
-NOTE 2: It is also not recommended to transfer your DB files
-as the DB files are constantly updated by the eAthena/jAthena
-team. Just readd your changes to the new DB files instead of
-replacing the new DB file with your old one.
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------

-1. Make sure all the files are setup properly (conf files)
-2. Load eAthena
-	2a. Run login-server
-	2b. Run char-server
-	2c. Run map-server
-3. Wait for map-server to finish loading.
-4. Play using a custom XML.

-Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------------------------------------------
-
-A: You're missing the cygwin dlls. Please get the latest dll at:
-   http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If you're unsure, asking 
-   around in our IRC chatroom will get you around too, but
-   always remember - use common sense and search before asking.
-
-Q: My map-server won't load! It appears to be loading things
-   before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!
-A: Use command line to load map-server. It should tell you the
-   error. If you're missing a map, update your kRO Sakray or
-   uncomment the map from map_athena.conf. If you have an
-   errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than
-   that, feel free to ask around.
-
-Q: My map-server failed to load 'adata.grf'! Where do I find
-   this adata.grf? My map-server won't load without it!
-A: The error that caused the map-server to not load is not the
-   adata.grf. You do NOT need to have adata.grf so that the map
-   server can load. The error is probably something else.
-
-Q: All 3 of the servers are loaded, but I am still having
-   problems accessing it! What do I do?
-A: First, check the IPs in map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf.
-   If that's correct, check the ports to make sure they match.
-   If that's correct too, you probably cannot handle the server
-   load. Lower the monster spawning rate using mob_count in
-   battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.
-
-Q: You said eAthena has 2-2 skills. Well, I tried it and there
-   are no 2-2 skills when I use 2-2 characters! You lie!
-A: No, I did not. You have an outdated Ragexe/Sakexe that does
-   not support 2-2 skills. Update it to a later one which does.
-
-Q: How do I start Guild Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!
-A: Read the help.txt for full list of commands that GMs can use.
-   @agitstart and @agitend is also listed there as commands to
-   start and end Guild Wars.
-
-Q: My Ragnarok Online crashed while playing with eAthena! What
-   do I do now?
-A: Well, if your Ragnarok crashes, it's most probably not
-   anything to do with eAthena. Something is wrong with your
-   Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.
-
-Q: Is eAthena compatible with mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB
-   instead of using text files?
-A: Yes, eAthena is compatible with mySQL. A tutorial on how to
-   setup this is coming soon.
-
-Q: Is eAthena compatible with msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB
-   instead of using text files?
-A: No, eAthena is not compatible with msSQL. You cannot use
-   msSQL with eAthena.
-
-Q: I found a bug! Where do I report it?
-A: Drop the developers a line at the IRC chatroom. Or just post
-   it in the bug report forum. We check them out too. :)
-
-Q: I know alot of C and I'm able to help improve eAthena and
-   add new features. How can I join your development team?
-A: Try talking to one of the current developers in the eAthena
-   channel.
-
-Q: What is this AthenaAdvanced/omniAthena that I keep hearing of?
-A: Huh? What's that?
-
-Q: Why does eAthena crash, and how come you can't prevent this?
-A: eAthena is a working in progress we never stated eAthena is
-   bug free, most likely no software is bugfree, if they state
-   this they are lying sons of beeps and you should sue them
-   for false advertisement.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-< What this file is. >
-
-	A setup of login-server (server which manages account) is described.
-	It mainly becomes a setup of an administrator.
-
-
-< Explanation of a key >
-
-If you change one of these parameters, you must restart login-server to update.
-If you repeat one parameter (except 'allow', 'deny' or 'ladminallowip') in the configuration file, only the latest will be validated.
-	'Allow', 'deny' and 'ladminallowip' parameters are list parameters. Add as many 'allow', 'deny' or 'ladminallowip' as you need.
-
-login_port
-	Port to bind login-server to (always binds to all IP addresses)
-	It is the port used by login-server. It can be omitted and a default is 6900.
-	Default value: 6900.
-
-admin_pass
-	It is the administrator password used to administrate the login-server through a remote connection.
-	You will found some tools in the tool directory, and specially the tool
-		./tool/ladmin (for Login ADMINistration), a perl software, which manages all accounts.
-	Void password will not work.
-	NOTICE: You must change this or attackers can exploit your server.
-	Default value: admin. CHANGES this default value to avoid hack.
-
-ladminallowip
-	It's a list parameter. To add an item in this list, just add a new line. Each line can only have 1 parameter.
-	This list indicates the IP that the server accepts for a remote administration.
-	This parameter accepts IP descriptions, like:
-	IP or the begining of IP: it's a characters match. Write an IP (123.456.789.012) or the begining of the IP (123.456.).
-		Because it's a characters match, the IP 123.4 matches with 123.4.xxx.yyy and 123.4z.xxx.yyy. So, add a final '.' to be sure of the IP.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1
-			allow: 192.168.10.
-	IP with number of bits for a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/<#_of_mask_bits>
-	Don't use the final '.', but use all four values.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1/32 (match only 1 IP, because 32 bits match all bits).
-			allow: 192.168.10/24 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
-	IP with mask of a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/345.678.901.234
-		Don't use the final '.', but use all four values for the IP and the mask.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 (match only 1 IP).
-			allow: 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
-	all: matches any IP.
-		Example:
-			allow: all.
-	clear: clears the list at this point. Really useful for 'import' parameter, in the new configuration file.
-		Example:
-			allow: clear.
-	Add as many IP's as you wish.
-	Default value: all.
-
-gm_pass
-	It is the required password when a player wants to change its (normal) account to a GM (Game Master) account.
-	It is used by the @gm command.
-	Level of gm is set with level_new_gm parameter.
-	NOTICE: You should also change this one.
-	Default value: gm. CHANGES this default value to avoid player hack.
-
-level_new_gm
-	Level of new GM created with @gm command. (default: 60)
-	If you set to 0, you disable creation of new GM with @gm.
-	To be able to create a gm with @gm, you must:
-	- give a level to this value (not 0)
-	- enable to level 0 the @gm command (atcommand_athena.conf) (default 100)
-	- enable gm commands to normal player (battle_athena.conf, atcommand_gm_only parameter)
-	- and normal player must give correct password when he use the @gm command
-	Possible value: 0 to 99
-	Default value: 60
-
-new_account
-	It is whether to permit new account creation.
-	When allowed, the player must add _F or _M at the end of its login account to create a new account.
-		This extension of the account gives the sex of the new created account.
-		Without the _F/M, the account must have at least 4 characters.
-		The account will not have e-mail to protect characters against deletion.
-		The given password at first connection (when the account is created) is the account password.
-	The value can be: 1 (to allow creation) or 0 (to forbid creation).
-	Default value: 1.
-
-account_filename
-	It specifies the accounts save file.
-	Gives the accounts txt database name and path to stores accounts information.

-
-gm_account_filename
-	It specifies which account IDs have GM privileges, and what level they have.
-	We recommand to use only ID value lower than first normal player ID (2000000).
-	Levels ranges from 0 (no privilege/normal player) to 99 (highest privilege).
-	If you change a value inside this file, you must restart login-server to use the new value
-	   or use reloadgm ladmin command.
-	Can be omited, a default is conf/GM_account.txt.
-	Default value: conf/GM_account.txt
-
-gm_account_filename_check_timer
-	Timer to check if GM_account file has been changed and reload GM account automaticaly

-	It's used for debug or hack check.
-	All information are displayed with the time stamp, the ip of the source, the packet number,
-		the number of received bytes and the detail of the packet with hex and text values. Example:
-			01-06-2004 21:25:21.579: receiving of an unknown packet -> disconnection
-			parse_login: connection #5 (ip: 82.64.111.96), packet: 0x4e92 (with being read: 28).

-	Default value: log/login_unknown_packets.log
-
-save_unknown_packets
-	It indicates if the unknown packets are saved or not.
-	The unknown packets received from the char-server or remote administration does not relate to this parameter,
-		because they are always saved.
-	The value can be: 1 (to save unknown packets) or 0 (to not save them).
-	Be careful: if you receive an attack, your hard disk can cause lag...
-	So, active this option with a speed hard disk or for debug only.

-
-add_to_unlimited_account
-	Give possibility to adjust (ladmin command: timeadd) the time of an unlimited account.
-	If set to on/1/yes..., the adjustment is be done from actual time to set the final time of the account.

-	      if not correct, you can read list of char-servers, but not look slots of characters (rejected by server).
-	Default value: yes
-
-order
-	This parameter controls how the login-server must use the 'allow' and 'deny' lists.
-	'Allow' and 'deny' are used to do IP lists.
-	3 possibilities:
-	'deny,allow': to sum it up, it's like 'allow if not deny'. The login-server only checks the 'deny' list.
-		If the connected IP is in the 'deny' list, the login-server refuses the connection, otherwise it accepts it.
-	'allow,deny': to sum it up, it's like 'deny if not allow'. The login-server only checks the 'allow' list.
-		If the connected IP is in the 'allow' list, the login-server accepts the connection, otherwise it refuses it.
-	'mutual-failture': to sum it up, it's like 'allow if in allow list and not in the deny list'.
-		The login-server checks the 'allow' list. If the connected IP is in the 'allow' list,
-		the login-server checks it in the 'deny' list. If the connectec IP is not in the 'deny' list,
-		the login-server accepts the conection, otherwise it refuses it.
-		In this case, a non 'allow' IP or a 'deny' IP will be never accepted.
-	If you don't use allow AND deny, all ip are authorised.
-	Default value: deny,allow.
-
-allow
-	It's a list parameter. To add an item in this list, just add a new line. Each line can only have 1 parameter.
-	This list depends on the 'order' parameter (read 'order' parameter to known what the login-server do with this list).
-	This parameter accepts IP descriptions, like:
-	IP or the begining of IP: it's a characters match. Write an IP (123.456.789.012) or the begining of the IP (123.456.).
-		Because it's a characters match, the IP 123.4 matches with 123.4.xxx.yyy and 123.4z.xxx.yyy. So, add a final '.' to be sure of the IP.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1
-			allow: 192.168.10.
-	IP with number of bits for a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/<#_of_mask_bits>
-	Don't use the final '.', but use all four values.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1/32 (match only 1 IP, because 32 bits match all bits).
-			allow: 192.168.10/24 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
-	IP with mask of a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/345.678.901.234
-		Don't use the final '.', but use all four values for the IP and the mask.
-		Example:
-			allow: 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 (match only 1 IP).
-			allow: 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
-	all: matches any IP.
-		Example:
-			allow: all.
-	clear: clears the list at this point. Really useful for 'import' parameter, in the new configuration file.
-		Example:
-			allow: clear.
-	It does not support the backward match of host name.
-	Default value: <no list>.
-
-deny
-	This list works exactly like the 'allow' list, but for the 'deny' list.
-
-import
-	Gives an other configuration file to include in.
-	You must write the additionnal configuration file name and path.
-	The mentionned file can include any parameter of the login configuration.
-	You can create a chain or configuration files if necessary.
-	Default value: <no_additional_configuration_file>.
-

-login_port: 6900
-admin_pass: admin
-ladminallowip: all
-gm_pass: gm
-level_new_gm: 60

+> eAthena - What we currently do not have
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+- Wedding System (In Progress!)
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+System Requirements
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+> Minimum System Requirements
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+800Mhz Processor
+256MB RAM
+
+NOTE: For this setup, it's recommended to not load as many maps
+and spawn as many monsters as it comes default with eAthena.
+To do this, comment off unused maps and control monster spawn
+rate using mob_count in battle_athena.conf.
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+> Recommended System Requirements
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+1+Ghz Processor
+512+MB RAM
+
+NOTE: For this setup, generally, running the eAthena default
+should be fine. If you have alot of extra RAM, you might even
+consider raising the mob_count in battle_athena.conf so that
+there will be more than normal monsters in your server
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+Setting up eAthena
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+> Setting up a new eAthena
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+1. Run the setupwizard program. This will assist you in
+   configuring Athena for the first time. Just follow the
+   instructions in the program.
+2. Edit motd.txt, grf-files.txt & .conf files as neccessary
+3. If you want to add a user, go to tools and use the AddUser
+   tool
+4. Run the login-server, char-server and map-server in the
+   main Athena directory
+5. You're done!
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+> Upgrading from older eAthena:
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+- From a release newer than 953 or 817:
+1. Transfer your old /save/ folder contents (Athena.txt,
+   Account.txt, Storage.txt, etc.) to the new /safe/ folder
+2. Transfer/Edit grf-files.txt, gm-account.txt and motd.txt as
+   neccessary
+3. Transfer any extra custom NPCs to the /npc/ folder and
+   edit if neccessary
+4. Edit .conf files to setup your server
+5. You're done!
+
+NOTE: It is not recommended to transfer your DB files
+as the DB files are constantly updated by the eAthena/jAthena
+team. Just read your changes to the new DB files instead of
+replacing the new DB file with your old one.
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+- From a release older than 670:
+1. Transfer your old data files (Athena.txt, Account.txt, 
+   Storage.txt, Pet.txt, etc) into the /save/ folder
+2. Transfer/Edit grf-files.txt, gm-account.txt as neccessary
+3. Transfer any extra custom NPCs/DBs to the new /npc/ folder
+   and edit if neccessary
+4. Edit .conf files to setup your server
+5. You're done!
+
+NOTE: It is not recommended to transfer your .conf files from
+your old eAthena setup to this new one because there are always
+changes and new additions to these .conf files all the time
+
+NOTE 2: It is also not recommended to transfer your DB files
+as the DB files are constantly updated by the eAthena/jAthena
+team. Just readd your changes to the new DB files instead of
+replacing the new DB file with your old one.
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+--------------------------------------------------------------

+2. Load eAthena
+	2a. Run login-server
+	2b. Run char-server
+	2c. Run map-server
+3. Wait for map-server to finish loading.
+4. Play using a custom XML.

+Frequently Asked Questions
+--------------------------------------------------------------
+
+A: You're missing the cygwin dlls. Please get the latest dll at:
+   http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If you're unsure, asking 
+   around in our IRC chatroom will get you around too, but
+   always remember - use common sense and search before asking.
+
+Q: My map-server won't load! It appears to be loading things
+   before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!
+A: Use command line to load map-server. It should tell you the
+   error. If you're missing a map, update your kRO Sakray or
+   uncomment the map from map_athena.conf. If you have an
+   errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than
+   that, feel free to ask around.
+
+Q: My map-server failed to load 'adata.grf'! Where do I find
+   this adata.grf? My map-server won't load without it!
+A: The error that caused the map-server to not load is not the
+   adata.grf. You do NOT need to have adata.grf so that the map
+   server can load. The error is probably something else.
+
+Q: All 3 of the servers are loaded, but I am still having
+   problems accessing it! What do I do?
+A: First, check the IPs in map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf.
+   If that's correct, check the ports to make sure they match.
+   If that's correct too, you probably cannot handle the server
+   load. Lower the monster spawning rate using mob_count in
+   battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.
+
+Q: You said eAthena has 2-2 skills. Well, I tried it and there
+   are no 2-2 skills when I use 2-2 characters! You lie!
+A: No, I did not. You have an outdated Ragexe/Sakexe that does
+   not support 2-2 skills. Update it to a later one which does.
+
+Q: How do I start Guild Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!
+A: Read the help.txt for full list of commands that GMs can use.
+   @agitstart and @agitend is also listed there as commands to
+   start and end Guild Wars.
+
+Q: My Ragnarok Online crashed while playing with eAthena! What
+   do I do now?
+A: Well, if your Ragnarok crashes, it's most probably not
+   anything to do with eAthena. Something is wrong with your
+   Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.
+
+Q: Is eAthena compatible with mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB
+   instead of using text files?
+A: Yes, eAthena is compatible with mySQL. A tutorial on how to
+   setup this is coming soon.
+
+Q: Is eAthena compatible with msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB
+   instead of using text files?
+A: No, eAthena is not compatible with msSQL. You cannot use
+   msSQL with eAthena.
+
+Q: I found a bug! Where do I report it?
+A: Drop the developers a line at the IRC chatroom. Or just post
+   it in the bug report forum. We check them out too. :)
+
+Q: I know alot of C and I'm able to help improve eAthena and
+   add new features. How can I join your development team?
+A: Try talking to one of the current developers in the eAthena
+   channel.
+
+Q: What is this AthenaAdvanced/omniAthena that I keep hearing of?
+A: Huh? What's that?
+
+Q: Why does eAthena crash, and how come you can't prevent this?
+A: eAthena is a working in progress we never stated eAthena is
+   bug free, most likely no software is bugfree, if they state
+   this they are lying sons of beeps and you should sue them
+   for false advertisement.

+1. MapMove 
+	MapMove command is a warping command which a GM can use on the server. 
+	There is no restriction such, that presently you can use, just have GM enabled. The usage where it is possible
+	 to use as /mm or /mapmove is as follows. 
+	/mm <fieldname>* X Y 
+	/mm <fieldname.gat>* X Y
+	/mapmove <fieldname>* X Y 
+	/mapmove <fieldname.gat>* X Y 
+	* means for field name type /where, please input the map name which appears in the execution time. gat is not always a necessary. 
+	(X Y) X coordinate and the Y-coordinate of the place where you would like to go, exact coordinates. However it does
+	if no X or Y, it will jump randomly.
+	Example:
+	 /mm payon 
+	/mapmove prontera.gat 167 158

+1. conf/login_athena.conf
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+< What this file is. >
+
+	A setup of login-server (server which manages account) is described.
+	It mainly becomes a setup of an administrator.
+
+
+< Explanation of a key >
+
+If you change one of these parameters, you must restart login-server to update.
+If you repeat one parameter (except 'allow', 'deny' or 'ladminallowip') in the configuration file, only the latest will be validated.
+	'Allow', 'deny' and 'ladminallowip' parameters are list parameters. Add as many 'allow', 'deny' or 'ladminallowip' as you need.
+
+login_port
+	Port to bind login-server to (always binds to all IP addresses)
+	It is the port used by login-server. It can be omitted and a default is 6900.
+	Default value: 6900.
+
+admin_pass
+	It is the administrator password used to administrate the login-server through a remote connection.
+	You will found some tools in the tool directory, and specially the tool
+		./tool/ladmin (for Login ADMINistration), a perl software, which manages all accounts.
+	Void password will not work.
+	NOTICE: You must change this or attackers can exploit your server.
+	Default value: admin. CHANGES this default value to avoid hack.
+
+ladminallowip
+	It's a list parameter. To add an item in this list, just add a new line. Each line can only have 1 parameter.
+	This list indicates the IP that the server accepts for a remote administration.
+	This parameter accepts IP descriptions, like:
+	IP or the begining of IP: it's a characters match. Write an IP (123.456.789.012) or the begining of the IP (123.456.).
+		Because it's a characters match, the IP 123.4 matches with 123.4.xxx.yyy and 123.4z.xxx.yyy. So, add a final '.' to be sure of the IP.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1
+			allow: 192.168.10.
+	IP with number of bits for a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/<#_of_mask_bits>
+	Don't use the final '.', but use all four values.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1/32 (match only 1 IP, because 32 bits match all bits).
+			allow: 192.168.10/24 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
+	IP with mask of a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/345.678.901.234
+		Don't use the final '.', but use all four values for the IP and the mask.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 (match only 1 IP).
+			allow: 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
+	all: matches any IP.
+		Example:
+			allow: all.
+	clear: clears the list at this point. Really useful for 'import' parameter, in the new configuration file.
+		Example:
+			allow: clear.
+	Add as many IP's as you wish.
+	Default value: all.
+
+gm_pass
+	It is the required password when a player wants to change its (normal) account to a GM (Game Master) account.
+	It is used by the @gm command.
+	Level of gm is set with level_new_gm parameter.
+	NOTICE: You should also change this one.

+
+save_unknown_packets
+	It indicates if the unknown packets are saved or not.
+	The unknown packets received from the char-server or remote administration does not relate to this parameter,
+		because they are always saved.
+	The value can be: 1 (to save unknown packets) or 0 (to not save them).

+
+add_to_unlimited_account
+	Give possibility to adjust (ladmin command: timeadd) the time of an unlimited account.
+	If set to on/1/yes..., the adjustment is be done from actual time to set the final time of the account.

+	If player doesn't have same IP, connection is refused.
+	Set to 0/off/no to not check IP of player.
+	Set to 1/on/yes if you want to check (default)
+	Note: if you enable this option, be sure that your (local/lan/wan) players use correct ip (in xml file) to contact servers,
+	      and that your LAN is correctly configured (!), and that LAN configuration of eathena is right.
+	      if not correct, you can read list of char-servers, but not look slots of characters (rejected by server).
+	Default value: yes
+
+order
+	This parameter controls how the login-server must use the 'allow' and 'deny' lists.
+	'Allow' and 'deny' are used to do IP lists.
+	3 possibilities:
+	'deny,allow': to sum it up, it's like 'allow if not deny'. The login-server only checks the 'deny' list.
+		If the connected IP is in the 'deny' list, the login-server refuses the connection, otherwise it accepts it.
+	'allow,deny': to sum it up, it's like 'deny if not allow'. The login-server only checks the 'allow' list.
+		If the connected IP is in the 'allow' list, the login-server accepts the connection, otherwise it refuses it.
+	'mutual-failture': to sum it up, it's like 'allow if in allow list and not in the deny list'.
+		The login-server checks the 'allow' list. If the connected IP is in the 'allow' list,
+		the login-server checks it in the 'deny' list. If the connectec IP is not in the 'deny' list,
+		the login-server accepts the conection, otherwise it refuses it.
+		In this case, a non 'allow' IP or a 'deny' IP will be never accepted.
+	If you don't use allow AND deny, all ip are authorised.
+	Default value: deny,allow.
+
+allow
+	It's a list parameter. To add an item in this list, just add a new line. Each line can only have 1 parameter.
+	This list depends on the 'order' parameter (read 'order' parameter to known what the login-server do with this list).
+	This parameter accepts IP descriptions, like:
+	IP or the begining of IP: it's a characters match. Write an IP (123.456.789.012) or the begining of the IP (123.456.).
+		Because it's a characters match, the IP 123.4 matches with 123.4.xxx.yyy and 123.4z.xxx.yyy. So, add a final '.' to be sure of the IP.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1
+			allow: 192.168.10.
+	IP with number of bits for a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/<#_of_mask_bits>
+	Don't use the final '.', but use all four values.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1/32 (match only 1 IP, because 32 bits match all bits).
+			allow: 192.168.10/24 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
+	IP with mask of a network: it's a logical match. Write the network like this: 123.456.789.012/345.678.901.234
+		Don't use the final '.', but use all four values for the IP and the mask.
+		Example:
+			allow: 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.255 (match only 1 IP).
+			allow: 192.168.10.0/255.255.255.0 (matches the network begining by 192.168.10).
+	all: matches any IP.
+		Example:
+			allow: all.
+	clear: clears the list at this point. Really useful for 'import' parameter, in the new configuration file.
+		Example:
+			allow: clear.
+	It does not support the backward match of host name.
+	Default value: <no list>.
+
+deny
+	This list works exactly like the 'allow' list, but for the 'deny' list.
+
+import
+	Gives an other configuration file to include in.
+	You must write the additionnal configuration file name and path.
+	The mentionned file can include any parameter of the login configuration.
+	You can create a chain or configuration files if necessary.
+	Default value: <no_additional_configuration_file>.
+

+Version 1.4.4
+===========================================================
+- Fixed a bug that caused the drop chance for all MVP drops
+  to become 0 when the "View Mob" option was used in the
+  Mob Drop List. (This was forgotten in the previous
+  update.)
+- Finally updated the "item_descriptions.txt" file.
+
+Version 1.4.3
+===========================================================
+- Fixed a bug that caused the drop chance for all drops to
+  become 0 when the "View Mob" option was used in the Mob
+  Drop List.
+- Fixed a bug that caused other mob entries to show up when
+  searching for a specific mob with an ID that can be found
+  as a string subset within the other mob's entry.
+- Fixed a bug that caused all new entries to go into the
+  "item_db2.txt" or "mob_db2.txt" files.
+- Tweaked some of the code for the Mob Skill Editor's
+  interface to better help with editing/creating skill
+  entries.
+
+Version 1.4.2
+===========================================================
+- Corrected the labels on the Mob Location Editor window.
+  Thanks to ShadowLady for pointing this out.
+
+Version 1.4.1
+===========================================================
+- Added functionality to the "Locations" button in the Mob
+  View. It will now open up the Mob Location Editor window.
+- Added a list of map names with a brief description to the
+  "ID Helper.txt" file to be used with the Map Helper.
+- Added a new option in the "ADE.ini" file that points to
+  the location of the files with the mobs' spawn points.
+- Fixed a bug with the Drop List feature that would keep
+  the window open till it was closed by the cancel button
+  or the window's close button.
+- Fixed a bug that caused the selected entry to not
+  properly update when saved. Thanks to Taike for reporting
+  this bug.
+- Redid the code for handling backups. So now when you
+  restore the backup files, it won't reload both the item
+  and mob related files, it only restores the backups for
+  item related files while using the Item View and mob
+  related files for the Mob View, and it will no longer
+  rename files as a backup file if they have no backup to
+  replace them with.
+
+Version 1.4.0
+===========================================================
+- Added the Mob Skill Editor feature to ADE. It is
+  available through the Skills button in the Mob View.
+  This adds handling of the "mob_skill_db.txt" file.
+- Fixed a bug with the Mob's Mode ID Helper that caused
+  the value to keep increasing everytime it was opened
+  beyond the first time. Thanks to Lupus for pointing this
+  out.
+- Changed the font to Microsoft Sans Serif from MS Sans
+  Serif to better support the garbled text some items,
+  mobs, or other things may have.
+
+Version 1.3.2
+===========================================================
+- Edited the print functions related to the the following
+  DB files: "item_bluebox.txt", "item_cardalbum.txt",
+  "item_giftbox.txt", "item_violetbox.txt", and
+  "mob_branch.txt". Thanks to ShadowLady for pointing out
+  this problem, as well as mentioning the label change
+  mentioned below.
+- Edited a label for Mob Modes in ID Helper from
+  "Detects Hidden (Sensor)" to "Detects Hidden".
+- Redid some of the code in the data processing subroutine
+  for the Item and Mob DB files. This should prevent any
+  overflow/invalid index errors. Thanks to Cheex for
+  pointing this out.
+- Fixed a bug that caused ADE to crash if any of the files
+  it would normally create backups of weren't there. This
+  is more common among eAthena 1.0 RCx Text installs, due
+  to their lack of an "item_db2.txt" file. (This occured
+  while trying to save changes.)
+
+Version 1.3.1
+===========================================================
+- Added an ID Helper for the Mob Mode ID section.
+- You can now see a list of all mobs that drop the selected
+  item in ADE's Item View by clicking on the button in the
+  upper right corner that's labeled "Mob Drop List".
+
+Version 1.3.0
+===========================================================
+- Added support for handling five more of the server's DB
+  files. ADE now handles: "item_bluebox.txt",
+  "item_cardalbum.txt", "item_giftbox.txt",
+  "item_violetbox.txt", and "mob_branch.txt".
+- Added a "Restore Backup Files" option in the File menu.
+- Changed "Revert" to "Revert to Last Save".
+- ADE now inserts a blank comment line after the initial
+  header line and the last line for most of the server
+  files.
+- ADE will automatically set the compatability mode to
+  support higher jobs, if it reads in a job ID for any such
+  jobs while set for low jobs only.
+- Fixed a couple of minor bugs and tweaked some of the code.
+
+Version 1.2.0
+===========================================================
+- Added support for generating the item files related to
+  card labels. The files are "cardpostfixnametable.txt" and
+  "cardprefixnametable.txt". The file "card_labels.txt" is
+  used to hold the card labels. (To create it, just copy
+  any "cardprefixnametable.txt" file to the DB folder being
+  used and rename it to "card_labels.txt".)
+- Fixed a bug found by Solid that caused the program to end
+  when a Mob's entry had an invalid Race ID or Element ID.
+  Also applied this same fix to some of the other IDs that
+  were vunerable.
+- Resized the maximum entries allowed for both Items and
+  Mobs. Items now have a current max of 15,000 entries and
+  Mobs have a max of 1,000. Both used to have 10,000.
+- Included a minimum ID and max ID allowed when dealing
+  with either Items or Mobs. The new Item ID range is 501
+  to 15000, and the new Mob ID range is 1001 to 2000. Any
+  entries with IDs out of the range won't be kept.
+- Slightly redid some of the code with printing the headers
+  of all files made with the program.
+
+Version 1.1.1
+===========================================================
+- Fixed a bug that caused the duplicate scan process to be
+  used again during adding and removing entries.
+- Replaced the text box for the Item's Sex ID with a combo
+  box. (The Item's Sex ID is used to determine if the item
+  is limited to a character's sex or can be used by all.)
+- Added the ID Helper for the Item View ID text box, and
+  included a file called "Item Helper.txt" that contains
+  the data for it.
+- Fixed a bug that caused the "Allow High Jobs" option for
+  compatibility to be turned on when even with it set to
+  being off by default.
+- Added a small bit of code to print "All Low Jobs" for
+  the description files for any items that only allow
+  characters with low jobs only to use the item.
+- Added a temp fix for any forms that can get stuck behind
+  the main window by allowing them to show up in the
+  taskbar.
+
+Version 1.1.0
+===========================================================
+- Added support for higher jobs like Knight Lord, Assassin
+  Cross, High Priest, etc.
+- Added duplication scanning for the DB entries. This will
+  remove duplicates found. (An entry is considered a
+  duplicate if the ID or DBName is the same.)
+- Fixed a bug that would cause the program to keep loading
+  if you closed the progress bar during startup.
+
+Version 1.0.1
+===========================================================
+- Fixed a bug that caused a null mob DB entry.
+- Added some code to let the program load even if it didn't
+  find the files used for loading.
+- Redid small portions of the code to increase performance.
+
+Version 1.0.0
+===========================================================
+- Merged the previous programs.
+- Added a mob DB file editor.
+
+Version 0.X
+===========================================================
+- Created Stand-alone Item Database Editor.
+- Created Stand-alone Item File Generator.

+*************************** NOTICE ***************************
+**************************************************************
+
+This program is free to use for any non-commercial private RO
+server running an Athena based server, and is povided as-is.
+The author of this program is only responsible for errors
+that occur only to this program while it is in operation,
+provided the program has not been modified in any way. If you
+come across any errors or would like to leave comments and/or
+suggestions about this program, please feel free to notify the
+author of this program at spamrat42@gmail.com.
+
+Please make sure to create a backup of your current database
+files and your data folder prior to using this program.
+
+==============================================================
+
+This package contains the following files...
+
+ADE.ini
+Athena Database Editor.exe
+history.txt
+ID Helper.txt
+readme.txt
+
+sample data (empty folder)
+
+sample db (folder)
+  card_labels.txt
+  item_descriptions.txt
+
+sample mobs (empty folder)
+  
+==============================================================
+= NOTE: All packages from 1.4.1 and newer will not include the
+=	files from the latest eAthena server distribution. So
+=	make sure to copy your current files from your server
+=	into the appropriate folders listed above, or set the
+=	correct paths in the ADE.ini file.
+==============================================================
+
+Thank you for downloading this tool I wrote for the eAthena
+817 Text based server, but it should work even with the more
+recent versions like eAthena 1.0 RC5. I hope you find this
+tool to be useful.
+
+The files in the db folder that come with this program are
+custom files that are to be used with ADE. To change the
+directory that this program looks in when opening or saving
+files, open the ADE.ini file and enter the full or relative
+path. The ADE.ini when first installed will already be
+pointing to the relative folders listed above. You can also
+simply copy your current db files to those folders, allowing
+you to edit them without editing the db files you're
+currently using.
+
+All entries that have been commented out will not be read,
+and won't be carried over into the new DB files. So please
+make sure to back them up before using this program for the
+first time. I will eventually add support for handling
+commented lines in future versions.
+
+One of the main features of this program will let you create
+updated files for the client's data folder as well as update
+the other relative db files for the server. When using this
+feature, the following files will be created...
+
+DB Folder - Server Files
+================================
+class_equip_db.txt
+item_value_db.txt
+
+Data Folder - Client Files
+================================
+cardpostfixnametable.txt
+cardprefixnametable.txt
+idnum2itemdesctable.txt
+idnum2itemdisplaynametable.txt
+itemslotcounttable.txt
+num2itemdesctable.txt
+num2itemdisplaynametable.txt
+
+Note: There is a checkbox that will say to click it if the
+      descriptions are garbled. Please only check after
+      trying the default description files it produces.
+
+If there are any files you think that were left out
+that should have been updated as well for the client's
+data folder, please let me know at the email address
+provided above.
+
+The item_descriptions.txt file is where all of the
+descriptions are stored. Please note if you're manually
+changing something in it, that you should the  character
+for a new line. (Use ALT + 175 to type it.) It should
+currently have the majority of the basic descriptions.
+You won't need to add how much defense or the attack
+power of equipment, as it will automatically be added
+when the files are created. (It gets the values directly
+from the item db files.)
+
+The card_labels.txt file is where all the card labels are
+stored. If you already have a custom set of card labels,
+just copy the cardprefixnametable.txt file from your data
+folder into the db folder and rename it to card_labels.txt.
+Any missing labels will or blank labels will result in the
+default label of "Carded" as a prefix.
+
+I will eventually try to update this program to try
+including other db files as well as to help make sure
+it works with all versions of the eAthena text based
+server from 817 to the current version. I'll also try
+to add more support for other files that are also needed
+to be generated for the client's data folder.
+
+==============================================================
+= NOTE 2: The item_descriptions.txt file that comes with this
+=         package has incorrect and blank entries. Please make
+=         sure to go over all the descriptions if you plan on
+=         using it to generate description files for your
+=         server's data folder.

+I get the error message
+"This application has failed to start because cygwin1.dll was not
+found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You're missing
+the cygwin
+dlls. Please get the latest dll at: http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If
+you're unsure, asking around in our IRC chatroom will get you around
+too, but always remember - use common sense and search before asking.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My map-server
+won't load! It
+appears to be loading things before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Use command line
+to load
+map-server. It should tell you the error. If you're missing a map,
+update your kRO Sakray or comment the map from map_athena.conf. If you
+have an errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than
+that, feel free to ask around.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My map-server
+failed to load
+'adata.grf'! Where do I find this adata.grf? My map-server won't load
+without it!<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: The error that
+caused the
+map-server to not load is not the adata.grf. adata.grf is NOT a
+requirement for the map-server to load. The error is probably related
+to something else.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: All 3 of the
+servers are
+loaded, but I am still having problems accessing it! What do I do?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: First, check the
+IPs in
+map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf. If those are correct, check the
+ports to make sure they match. If that's correct too, you probably
+cannot handle the server load. Lower the monster spawning rate using
+mob_count in battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: How do I start
+Guild
+Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Read the GM
+Command page for
+full list of commands that GMs can use, including the command for this.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My Ragnarok
+Online crashed
+while playing with eAthena! What do I do now?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Well, if your
+Ragnarok
+crashes, it's most probably not anything to do with eAthena. Something
+is wrong with your Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: Is eAthena
+compatible with
+mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB instead of using text files?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Yes, eAthena is
+compatible
+with mySQL. A tutorial on how to setup this is coming soon.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: Is eAthena
+compatible with
+msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB instead of using text files?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: No, eAthena is
+not
+compatible with msSQL. You cannot use msSQL with eAthena.<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: I found a bug!
+Where do I
+report it?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Drop the
+developers a line
+at the IRC chatroom. Or just post it in the bug report forum. We check
+them out too. :)<br>
+            <br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: I know alot of C
+and I'm
+able to help improve eAthena and add new features. How can I join your
+development team?<br>
+            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Try talking to
+one of the
+current developers in the eAthena channel.<span

+== Spell language
+
+* Comments: One-line comments using '#' or '//' as prefix
+* names vs. invocations:  spells and anchors have both names
+  and invocations.  Names are used to refer to spells and
+  anchors from within scripts without revealing their
+  invocations.
+
+
+Each spell specification file consists of a sequence of definitions of
+globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.
+
+Types:
+------
+  These are the primitive types:
+  * int
+  * string
+  * dir	       (a direction: N, S, SE, NW etc.)
+  * location   (a single spot in the world)
+  * entity     (a PC, NPC, or monster)
+  * area       (a set of locations)
+  * spell      (a spell)
+  * invocation (a spell instance)
+  * fail       (a separate type that arises implicitly when a function
+    	        fails)
+
+  `fail' arises in special circumstances in some functions, e.g. when
+trying to divide by zero, or when function parameters fail to
+type-check.  When a fail value flows into an operation, than that
+operation is skipped.  When a fail value flows into a function, then
+that function evaluates to fail, except for
+
+  * if_then_else (which permits `fail' in its true or false branch)
+  * failed (which returns true iff the argument is of type fail).
+
+  We will use standard functional type notation:
+
+  `int * string -> entity' denotes the type of a function that accepts
+an integer and a string and returns an entity.  We use the return `()'
+for operations (which return nothing).
+
+Globals:
+--------
+  A `global' is a global variable, declared and defined in the
+same line:
+
+	foo = "this is a string";
+
+  Expressions can be arbitrary language expressions.  Note that globals
+can only reference the values of globals defined earlier in the same
+program.
+
+  There are two special globals:
+
+  * min_casttime : int
+    Minimal number of milliseconds of cast delay, no matter what any
+    given spell may say.  Cast delay is the time before the next spell
+    can be cast.
+
+  * obscure : int
+    Chance of a character of a given spell to be obscured (masked out
+    by an asterisk).
+
+
+  Globals can also be defined as CONST (though this should not be done
+for the special globals listed above or they will not take effect.)
+CONST-defined globals cannot be re-defined.
+
+
+Expressions:
+------------
+  Expressions occur in globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.
+Expressions evaluate to values of a given type.  Expressions can be
+simple literals, area literals, infix expressions, function
+applications, or variable refecences.
+
+- Simple literals:
+  * 42, 0xff: int literals
+  * N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW : dir literals
+  * "foo bar" : string literals
+
+- Area literals:
+  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26)
+    This area denotes a single field on a map (new_3-1.gat,
+    co-ordinates (26,26).
+  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+ (10, 10) 
+    This area is 100 fields, stretching to a field of size 10x10 to
+    the south and east of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.
+  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) towards S (5, 3)
+    This area is a rectangular field of depth 3 and width 5 to the
+    south of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.  `depth 3' here means that it
+    stretches three fields to the south.  `width 5' here means that it
+    extends five fields to the east and five to the west of the
+    specified coordinate, for a total width of 11.
+    The only directions supported here are S, E, N, W.
+
+- Infix expressions:
+  Infix expressions are special functions in which the operator is
+  written between two expressions.  Infix expressions largely follow
+  the C precedence rules.  The following infix operators are
+  supported:
+  * addition (+) (operates on ints, concatenates strings, and
+    	     	  constructs the union of areas)
+  * subtraction (- : int * int -> int)
+  * multiplication (* : int * int -> int)
+  * division (/ : int * int -> int, may fail)
+  * modulo (% : int * int -> int, may fail)
+  * comparison (<, >, >=, <=, =, <> : int * int -> int)
+    Comparison operators generally work on ints and strings.
+    (In)equality checks work on all values except for areas.
+    Note that "==" and "!=" are available as alternatives for "=" and
+    "<>" (respectively).
+  * conjunction and disjunction (&&, || : int * int -> int).  Note
+    that these are not short-circuit.
+  * Bitwise or (| : int * int -> int)
+  * Bitwise and (& : int * int -> int)
+  * Bitwise xor (^ : int * int -> int)
+  * Shift left and right (<<, >> : int * int -> int)
+
+- Function applications:
+  Function applications are written as
+
+    f(arg1, ..., argn)
+
+  where each `argi' is an arbitrary expression.
+  For a complete list of Functions, see `functions' below.
+
+- Variable references:
+  The expression (foo + 1) references a variable `foo' which must have
+  been previously defined.
+
+
+Anchors:
+--------
+  Anchors are teleport anchors; spells can look them up by name.  Each
+teleport anchor is written as
+
+    TELEPORT-ANCHOR <id> : <invocation-string> = <location>
+
+  For example:
+
+    TELEPORT-ANCHOR tulimshar : "home" = @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+(10, 10) 
+
+  This maps the teleport anchor `tulimshar' to an area in new_3-1.gat
+binds it to the name "home".  The function `anchor' can look up
+teleport anchors (cf. the function library).
+
+
+Spells:
+-------
+  Each spell is written either as
+
+    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> : <name> = <spelldef>
+
+  or as
+
+    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> (<id> : <sty>) : <name> = <spelldef>
+
+  For example,
+
+    SPELL random_dance : "zxr" = ...
+
+  creates a spell `random_dance' and makes it available under the
+invocation "zxr".  The string `...' is not a valid <spelldef>; we will
+look at proper spelldefs below.  An alternative example illustrates
+the use of parameters:
+
+    SPELL shout (message : STRING) : "zzx" = ...
+
+  This defines a spell `shout' (bound to invocation "zzx") that takes
+a parameter `message' of type STRING.  Valid types are STRING and PC:
+PC parameters are automatically translated into a player character
+entity of that name, or mapped to the caster if the specified name
+does not map to a player character or is missing.
+
+  The list of spell modifiers is short:
+
+  * SILENT means that the spell's invocation will never be broadcast,
+    	   not even obscured.
+  * LOCAL means that the spell is bound to the location it was cast at
+    	  and will not `travel' with the caster.
+  * NONMAGIC means that the spell is not affected by the caster's ability
+          to perform magic.  Typically used for special (quest) keywords.
+
+  Modifiers may be given in any order, but only once.
+
+- Spell bodies
+
+  Spell bodies consist of three parts: LET bindings, spell guards and
+  effects.  LET bindings locally bind names to values.  Spell guards
+  are constraints that must be satisfied for the spell to be
+  triggered.  Effects describes what happens if the spell is
+  successfully triggered.  Spells may have multiple guards and
+  effects.
+
+  Consider the following example:
+
+    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
+          LET x = "kappa"
+              y = "sigma"
+          IN
+          (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) => EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
+        | (MANA 20) => EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch")
+
+  This defines a spell `plugh' with two let bindings (`x' bound to
+  "kappa" and `y' bound to "sigma") and two `branches' which are
+  tested in sequence.  The first branch tests whether the caster has
+  one spellpoint and owns a pearl-- if so, the effect of sending a
+  message "First branch" to the caster is triggered.
+
+  However, if the spell guard is not satisfied, the magic engine
+  examines the second branch.  Now, if the caster has 20 spellpoints,
+  we INSTEAD trigger the effect of sending the message "Second branch"
+  to the caster.
+
+- Spell guards
+
+  Spell guards can be omitted; in that case, just use the effect
+  itself.  Otherwise they can be any of the following:
+  * MANA x:  Require x spellpoints to be present.  If this spellguard
+    is taken, x mana will be consumed implicitly.  This requirement is
+    cumulative.
+  * CASTTIME x:  Require that the caster spend x milliseconds until
+    the next spell can be cast.  This requirement is cumulative.  If
+    the total casttime for a spell is less than the global variable
+    min_casttime, then the latter supercedes the specified spell cast
+    delay.
+  * REQUIRE <expr>:  Test that the specified expression evaluates to
+    nonzero and does not fail.  Requirements are cumulative.
+  * CATALYSTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
+    items.  This effect is cumulative.
+  * COMPONENTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
+    items.  If the branch suceeeds, all items specified here are
+    consumed.  This effect is cumulative.
+
+  Items can be specified as follows:
+  * [ 700, 701 ]	-- require one item of item ID 700 and one of 701.
+  * [ 700, 3 * 701 ]	-- require 1 item of item ID 700 and 3 of 701.
+  * [ "Pearl" ]		-- require one item named `Pearl' in the item DB.
+
+  Spell guards can be combined as follows:
+  * `or': disjunction.  The first matching path is taken.
+  * (a, ..., n): conjunction.  a, n, and everything in between must be
+    satisfied.
+  * a => b:  Implication.  If `a' is satisfied, try to satisfy `b'.
+    This operation is useful to combine different branches (see
+    below.)
+
+  Different branches of spell effects are separated by the vertical
+  bar `|'.  For example,
+
+    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
+        MANA 5 => (  (CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
+                            EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
+                   | (MANA 20) =>
+                            EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch");)
+
+  will always try to deduct 5 Mana points but then make a choice of
+  whether to go to the first branch (if the player has `Pearl') or to
+  the second (if the player does not have `Pear' but has another 20
+  spell points, for a total of 25 spell points, all of which will be
+  consumed in that case.)
+
+
+- Effects
+
+  Effects describe what happens when a spell is triggered.  Each
+  spell has at least one EFFECT specification, which looks as follows:
+
+    EFFECT <effectlist> [ ATTRIGGER <effectlist> ] [ ATEND <effectlist> ]
+
+  The three parts are as follows:
+  * EFFECT:  All effects here are executed as soon as the spell is
+    triggered.
+  * ATEND:  All steps described here are executed when the spell
+    finishes.   Note that the spell may remain active after all steps
+    from the EFFECT section have been taken; this happens when the spell
+    triggers a status change (using the `status_change' operation,
+    as described in the operations library).  In that case the spell
+    will terminate only after all status changes have finished.
+    The ATEND section is not called when the spell finishes due to the
+    caster dying.
+  * ATTRIGGER:  This section is used only for the `override_attack'
+    operation and described there.
+
+  Before effects are executed, the engine defines the following
+  variables:
+
+  * The parameter (if any)
+  * caster : entity (the caster of this spell)
+  * spellpower : int (the caster's spellpower, normally 6 -- 198)
+  * location : location (the location the spell is currently at)
+  * self_spell : spell (the current spell)
+  * self_invocation : invocation (the current spell instance)
+
+  The engine can then execute the following effects from the effect list:
+  * SKIP;	    #  a no-op
+  * ABORT;	    #  Abort the spell, don't run ATEND, don't consume a
+    		    #    trigger charge (cf. `override_attack')
+  * END;	    #  Skip to the ATEND block
+  * WAIT <expr>;    #  Wait <expr> milliseconds before continuing
+  * <id> = <expr>;  #  Set <id> to the result of evaluating <expr>
+  * (<s1> ... <sn>) #  Execute statements <s1> through <sn> in sequence
+  * IF <c>	    #  Test condition <c>.  If nonzero,
+    THEN <s1>	    #    execute <s1>.  Otherwise,
+    ELSE <s2> 	    #    execute <s2>.
+                    #    The `ELSE' branch can be omitted.
+
+  * FOREACH <k> <id> IN <expr> DO <s>
+                    # Evaluate <expr> to an area, find all entities in
+		    #   the area that match <k>, randomise this list,
+		    #   bind <id> to each in turn and execute <s>.
+
+    Example:
+
+    FOREACH ENTITY t IN rbox(location(caster), 20)
+      DO aggravate(t, 0, caster);
+      	 	    # This aggravates all entities within 20 paces of
+		    #   the caster to attack the caster.
+
+    Valid values for <k> are
+    + ENTITY : PC or mob
+    + PC
+    + MOB
+    + TARGET : mob, PC (but only if we are on a PvP map)
+
+  * FOR <id> = <start> TO <stop> DO <stmt>
+    # This will iterate from <start> to <stop> (inclusively), bind
+    # <id> to the current iteration value, and execute <stmt>.
+
+  * BREAK;
+    # This will break out of the current FOR loop, FOREACH loop, or
+    # procedure.
+
+  * <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
+    # This executes an operation.  See `Operations', below, for a
+    # list.
+
+  * CALL <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
+    # This will execute a procedure, after binding the actual
+    # parameters from <expr1> to <exprn> to the formal procedure
+    # parameters.
+
+  * { ... }
+    # This executes arbitrary eAthena script code.  The following
+    # variables script variables are bound implicitly:
+    # - @caster_name$ is the name of the spellcaster
+    # - @caster and @target are also bound, to useless values (sorry.)
+    #
+    # By default, script popup boxes are sent to the caster.  This can
+    # be overridden by setting the special `script_target' variable.
+
+Procedures:
+-----------
+  Procedures are defined as
+
+    PROCEDURE <id> ( <id>, ... , <id> ) = <effectlist>
+
+  For example,
+
+    PROCEDURE testproc(x) = message(caster, "foo(" + x + )");
+                            y = 10;
+                            x = 20;
+
+  defines a procedure `testproc' with one formal parameter `x'.
+  Procedure execution is nonrecursive and uses dynamic scoping.  The
+  latter means that it can modify variables in the caller's scope.  In
+  the above example, the assignment to `y' will be visible to the
+  caller.  The assignment to `x' however will be not be visible, since
+  that assignment goes to the parameter and is therefore limited in
+  scope to `testproc'.  More precisely,
+
+      EFFECT x = 0; y = 0; testproc(1);
+      	     message(caster, "x=" + x + ", y=" + y);
+
+  would print
+
+      foo(1)
+      x=0, y=10
+
+  (note how the update to x is isolated from the caller.)

+    Compute the length of a string, in characters.
+
+  + substr : string * int * int -> string

+    extract_healer_experience(pc, xp) extracts up to `xp' points.
+
+  + is_pc : entity -> bool
+    Determines whether the target is a player character
+
+Operations:

+
+  + sfx : entity * int * int -> ()
+        | location * int *int -> ()
+    Trigger a special effect (specified by sfx ID) for an entity or a
+    location.  The int specifies a delay until the effect is issued.
+
+  + itemheal : entity * int * int -> ()

+
+  + instaheal : entity * int * int -> ()
+    itemheal(entity, hp, sp) heals instantly.
+
+  + shroud : entity * int -> ()
+    shroud(entity, flags) hides the entity's name (only for PCs).
+    Flags:  0x01: Hide PC'ss name when talking
+            0x02: Shroud vanishes when player picks something up
+            0x04: Shroud vanishes when player talks
+    The shroud will not affect players in visible range until the
+    entity has left and re-entered their field of vision.  This can be
+    enforced by warping.
+
+  + unshroud : entity -> ()
+    Counter a shroud.
+
+  + message : entity * string -> ()
+    Send a message to the entity.
+
+  + messenger_npc : location * int
+                    * string * string * int -> ()
+    messenger_npc(location, image, npc_name, message, duration)
+    creates a messenger NPC looking like the `image' at `location',
+    with name `npc_name' and delivering the `message' when clicked
+    upon.  The NPC disappears after the `duration' in ms has expired.
+
+  + move : entity * dir -> ()
+    Move the entity into the specified direction, unless that
+    direction is blocked.
+
+  + warp : entity * location -> ()
+    Warp entity to specified location.
+
+  + spawn : area * entity * int * int * int * int -> ()
+    spawn(area, owner, mob_id, attitude, count, lifetime) spawns for a
+    limited `lifetime' (in ms) a total of `count' monsters of kind
+    `mob_id' in `area'.  `attitude' specifies how they behave:
+      0 : attack everyone
+      1 : be friendly
+      2 : attack enemies of `owner' and give XP to `owner' if successful
+
+  + banish : entity -> ()
+    If the entity was spawned by the `spawn' operation, eliminate it.
+
+
+  + status_change : entity * int * int
+                    * int * int * int * int -> ()
+    status_change(entity, status, v1, v2, v3, v4, duration) initiates
+    a status change.  The precise status change (and the meaning of
+    `v1', `v2', `v3', `v4') varies depending on `status'.  This
+    operation may delay spell termination (and the ATEND effect).
+    ATEND can therefore be used to notify the caster that the status
+    change has finished.
+
+  + stop_status_change : entity * int
+    Stops a status change
+
+  + override_attack : entity * int * int
+                             * int * int *int * int -> ()
+    override_attack(entity, charges, delay, range, icon, animation, stop)
+    overrides the entity's current attack (only for PCs).  The entity
+    will have `charges' attacks that instead result in calling the
+    ATTRIGGER effect for this spell.  When this operation is called,
+    the spell environment (variables etc.) is cloned into a separate
+    invocation.  This special invocation will be triggered every time
+    the entity tries to attack, until they have run out of charages (at
+    which time the previous behaviour is restored.)
+    `delay' specifies the attack delay.
+    `range' specifies the attack range as shown in the client GUI.
+    `icon' is the ID of a status-effect ID that will be displayed
+    while the spell is in effect.
+    `animation' is the attack animation ID that should be used.
+    `stop' decides whether attacking should stop once the spell is out
+    of charges (1) or continue (0). (Note: this doesn't properly work,
+    possibly due to client issues.  Always use 0.)
+
+    Note that if the ATTRIGGER effect ABORTs, no charge will be
+    consumed.
+
+    ATTRIGGER can refernece the player's target via the `target'
+    variable.
+
+    Example:
+
+    SPELL tshuffle : "zvp" =
+        (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
+        EFFECT
+                override_attack(caster, 3, 500, 10, 700, 31);
+        ATTRIGGER
+                IF (not (line_of_sight(location, location(target))))
+                THEN (message (caster, "No line of sight!"); ABORT;)
+                FOR i = 0 TO 10 DO (move(target, random_dir(0)););
+
+    This overrides the caster's attack for three attacks (attack delay
+    500, range 10) to instead randomly move around any entity that the
+    player tries to attack by up to 11 paces.
+
+  + create_item : entity * int * int -> ()
+                | entity * string * int -> ()
+    create_item(entity, item, count) gives the `entity' `count'
+    instances of `item'.  As usual, `item' can be either a string name
+    or an item ID.
+
+  + aggravate : entity * int * entity -> ()
+    aggravate (victim, mode, target) causes the `victim' to
+      mode = 0: attack `target'
+      mode = 1: become universally permanently aggressive
+      mode = 2: both of the above
+
+  + injure : entity * entity * int * int -> ()
+    injure(attacker, defender, hp, sp) causes damage to the defender
+    from the attacker (possibly killing, giving XP etc.), unless the
+    defender is immortal (NPC) or a PC on a non-PvP map.
+
+  + emote : entity * int -> ()
+    Issues the specified emotion to the specified entity.
+
+  + set_script_variable : entity * string * int -> ()
+    Sets a script variable to the specified value
+
+  + set_hair_colour : entity * int -> ()
+    Sets the hair colour of the specified entity to the specified
+    value (must be a PC).
+
+  + set_hair_style : entity * int -> ()
+    Adjusts the hair style of a PC.
+
+  + drop_item : location * (int | string) * int * int -> ()
+    drop_item(place, "name", count, duration) drops `count' items
+    (where count may be zero) of name "name" at `place'.  The items
+    vanish again after `duration'.
+
+  + drop_item_for : location * (int | string)
+                    * int * int * entity * int -> ()
+    drop_item_for(place, obj, count, duration, owner, delay) works
+    like drop_item(place, obj, count, duration), except that the item
+    can only be picked up by `owner' for the next `delay'
+    milliseconds, modulo pickup rules (spousal pickup, out-of-range).
+
+  + gain_experience : entity * int * int * int -> ()
+    gain_experience(player, base_xp, job_xp, reason) gives expereince
+    points to `player'.  If reason is 0, they are handed out normally,
+    but if reason is 1, then those experience points are NOT added to
+    the pool of experience points that healers can draw from `player'.
+
+  + resurrect : entity * int * int * int -> ()
+    resurrect(player, regenerated_hp, regenerated_sp, flag) resurrect
+    `player'.  If flag is 0, regenerated_hp and regenerated_sp are
+    percentage of the maximum value but if flag is 1, then those 
+    values are the real hp and sp that will be assigned to `player'.
+
+
+
+Script API updates:
+-------------------
+Two new script API functions are available:
+
+  * getspellinvocation : string -> string
+    Looks up a spell by spell ID and returns the spell's invocation.
+  * getanchorinvocation : string -> string
+    Looks up a teleport anchor by anchor ID and returns the invocation.

-Version 1.4.4
-===========================================================
-- Fixed a bug that caused the drop chance for all MVP drops
-  to become 0 when the "View Mob" option was used in the
-  Mob Drop List. (This was forgotten in the previous
-  update.)
-- Finally updated the "item_descriptions.txt" file.
-
-Version 1.4.3
-===========================================================
-- Fixed a bug that caused the drop chance for all drops to
-  become 0 when the "View Mob" option was used in the Mob
-  Drop List.
-- Fixed a bug that caused other mob entries to show up when
-  searching for a specific mob with an ID that can be found
-  as a string subset within the other mob's entry.
-- Fixed a bug that caused all new entries to go into the
-  "item_db2.txt" or "mob_db2.txt" files.
-- Tweaked some of the code for the Mob Skill Editor's
-  interface to better help with editing/creating skill
-  entries.
-
-Version 1.4.2
-===========================================================
-- Corrected the labels on the Mob Location Editor window.
-  Thanks to ShadowLady for pointing this out.
-
-Version 1.4.1
-===========================================================
-- Added functionality to the "Locations" button in the Mob
-  View. It will now open up the Mob Location Editor window.
-- Added a list of map names with a brief description to the
-  "ID Helper.txt" file to be used with the Map Helper.
-- Added a new option in the "ADE.ini" file that points to
-  the location of the files with the mobs' spawn points.
-- Fixed a bug with the Drop List feature that would keep
-  the window open till it was closed by the cancel button
-  or the window's close button.
-- Fixed a bug that caused the selected entry to not
-  properly update when saved. Thanks to Taike for reporting
-  this bug.
-- Redid the code for handling backups. So now when you
-  restore the backup files, it won't reload both the item
-  and mob related files, it only restores the backups for
-  item related files while using the Item View and mob
-  related files for the Mob View, and it will no longer
-  rename files as a backup file if they have no backup to
-  replace them with.
-
-Version 1.4.0
-===========================================================
-- Added the Mob Skill Editor feature to ADE. It is
-  available through the Skills button in the Mob View.
-  This adds handling of the "mob_skill_db.txt" file.
-- Fixed a bug with the Mob's Mode ID Helper that caused
-  the value to keep increasing everytime it was opened
-  beyond the first time. Thanks to Lupus for pointing this
-  out.
-- Changed the font to Microsoft Sans Serif from MS Sans
-  Serif to better support the garbled text some items,
-  mobs, or other things may have.
-
-Version 1.3.2
-===========================================================
-- Edited the print functions related to the the following
-  DB files: "item_bluebox.txt", "item_cardalbum.txt",
-  "item_giftbox.txt", "item_violetbox.txt", and
-  "mob_branch.txt". Thanks to ShadowLady for pointing out
-  this problem, as well as mentioning the label change
-  mentioned below.
-- Edited a label for Mob Modes in ID Helper from
-  "Detects Hidden (Sensor)" to "Detects Hidden".
-- Redid some of the code in the data processing subroutine
-  for the Item and Mob DB files. This should prevent any
-  overflow/invalid index errors. Thanks to Cheex for
-  pointing this out.
-- Fixed a bug that caused ADE to crash if any of the files
-  it would normally create backups of weren't there. This
-  is more common among eAthena 1.0 RCx Text installs, due
-  to their lack of an "item_db2.txt" file. (This occured
-  while trying to save changes.)
-
-Version 1.3.1
-===========================================================
-- Added an ID Helper for the Mob Mode ID section.

-  files. ADE now handles: "item_bluebox.txt",
-  "item_cardalbum.txt", "item_giftbox.txt",
-  "item_violetbox.txt", and "mob_branch.txt".
-- Added a "Restore Backup Files" option in the File menu.
-- Changed "Revert" to "Revert to Last Save".
-- ADE now inserts a blank comment line after the initial
-  header line and the last line for most of the server
-  files.
-- ADE will automatically set the compatability mode to
-  support higher jobs, if it reads in a job ID for any such
-  jobs while set for low jobs only.
-- Fixed a couple of minor bugs and tweaked some of the code.
-
-Version 1.2.0
-===========================================================
-- Added support for generating the item files related to
-  card labels. The files are "cardpostfixnametable.txt" and
-  "cardprefixnametable.txt". The file "card_labels.txt" is
-  used to hold the card labels. (To create it, just copy
-  any "cardprefixnametable.txt" file to the DB folder being
-  used and rename it to "card_labels.txt".)
-- Fixed a bug found by Solid that caused the program to end
-  when a Mob's entry had an invalid Race ID or Element ID.
-  Also applied this same fix to some of the other IDs that
-  were vunerable.
-- Resized the maximum entries allowed for both Items and
-  Mobs. Items now have a current max of 15,000 entries and
-  Mobs have a max of 1,000. Both used to have 10,000.
-- Included a minimum ID and max ID allowed when dealing
-  with either Items or Mobs. The new Item ID range is 501
-  to 15000, and the new Mob ID range is 1001 to 2000. Any
-  entries with IDs out of the range won't be kept.
-- Slightly redid some of the code with printing the headers
-  of all files made with the program.
-
-Version 1.1.1
-===========================================================
-- Fixed a bug that caused the duplicate scan process to be
-  used again during adding and removing entries.
-- Replaced the text box for the Item's Sex ID with a combo
-  box. (The Item's Sex ID is used to determine if the item
-  is limited to a character's sex or can be used by all.)
-- Added the ID Helper for the Item View ID text box, and
-  included a file called "Item Helper.txt" that contains
-  the data for it.
-- Fixed a bug that caused the "Allow High Jobs" option for
-  compatibility to be turned on when even with it set to
-  being off by default.
-- Added a small bit of code to print "All Low Jobs" for
-  the description files for any items that only allow
-  characters with low jobs only to use the item.
-- Added a temp fix for any forms that can get stuck behind
-  the main window by allowing them to show up in the
-  taskbar.
-
-Version 1.1.0
-===========================================================
-- Added support for higher jobs like Knight Lord, Assassin
-  Cross, High Priest, etc.
-- Added duplication scanning for the DB entries. This will
-  remove duplicates found. (An entry is considered a
-  duplicate if the ID or DBName is the same.)
-- Fixed a bug that would cause the program to keep loading
-  if you closed the progress bar during startup.
-
-Version 1.0.1
-===========================================================
-- Fixed a bug that caused a null mob DB entry.
-- Added some code to let the program load even if it didn't
-  find the files used for loading.
-- Redid small portions of the code to increase performance.
-
-Version 1.0.0
-===========================================================
-- Merged the previous programs.
-- Added a mob DB file editor.
-
-Version 0.X
-===========================================================
-- Created Stand-alone Item Database Editor.
-- Created Stand-alone Item File Generator.

-*************************** NOTICE ***************************
-**************************************************************
-
-This program is free to use for any non-commercial private RO
-server running an Athena based server, and is povided as-is.
-The author of this program is only responsible for errors
-that occur only to this program while it is in operation,
-provided the program has not been modified in any way. If you
-come across any errors or would like to leave comments and/or
-suggestions about this program, please feel free to notify the
-author of this program at spamrat42@gmail.com.
-
-Please make sure to create a backup of your current database
-files and your data folder prior to using this program.
-
-==============================================================
-
-This package contains the following files...
-
-ADE.ini
-Athena Database Editor.exe
-history.txt
-ID Helper.txt
-readme.txt
-
-sample data (empty folder)
-
-sample db (folder)
-  card_labels.txt
-  item_descriptions.txt
-
-sample mobs (empty folder)
-  
-==============================================================
-= NOTE: All packages from 1.4.1 and newer will not include the
-=	files from the latest eAthena server distribution. So
-=	make sure to copy your current files from your server
-=	into the appropriate folders listed above, or set the
-=	correct paths in the ADE.ini file.
-==============================================================
-
-Thank you for downloading this tool I wrote for the eAthena
-817 Text based server, but it should work even with the more
-recent versions like eAthena 1.0 RC5. I hope you find this
-tool to be useful.
-
-The files in the db folder that come with this program are
-custom files that are to be used with ADE. To change the
-directory that this program looks in when opening or saving
-files, open the ADE.ini file and enter the full or relative
-path. The ADE.ini when first installed will already be
-pointing to the relative folders listed above. You can also
-simply copy your current db files to those folders, allowing
-you to edit them without editing the db files you're
-currently using.
-
-All entries that have been commented out will not be read,
-and won't be carried over into the new DB files. So please
-make sure to back them up before using this program for the
-first time. I will eventually add support for handling
-commented lines in future versions.
-
-One of the main features of this program will let you create
-updated files for the client's data folder as well as update
-the other relative db files for the server. When using this
-feature, the following files will be created...
-
-DB Folder - Server Files
-================================
-class_equip_db.txt
-item_value_db.txt
-
-Data Folder - Client Files
-================================
-cardpostfixnametable.txt
-cardprefixnametable.txt
-idnum2itemdesctable.txt
-idnum2itemdisplaynametable.txt
-itemslotcounttable.txt
-num2itemdesctable.txt
-num2itemdisplaynametable.txt
-
-Note: There is a checkbox that will say to click it if the
-      descriptions are garbled. Please only check after
-      trying the default description files it produces.
-
-If there are any files you think that were left out
-that should have been updated as well for the client's
-data folder, please let me know at the email address
-provided above.
-
-The item_descriptions.txt file is where all of the
-descriptions are stored. Please note if you're manually
-changing something in it, that you should the  character
-for a new line. (Use ALT + 175 to type it.) It should
-currently have the majority of the basic descriptions.
-You won't need to add how much defense or the attack
-power of equipment, as it will automatically be added
-when the files are created. (It gets the values directly
-from the item db files.)
-
-The card_labels.txt file is where all the card labels are
-stored. If you already have a custom set of card labels,
-just copy the cardprefixnametable.txt file from your data
-folder into the db folder and rename it to card_labels.txt.
-Any missing labels will or blank labels will result in the
-default label of "Carded" as a prefix.
-
-I will eventually try to update this program to try
-including other db files as well as to help make sure
-it works with all versions of the eAthena text based
-server from 817 to the current version. I'll also try
-to add more support for other files that are also needed
-to be generated for the client's data folder.
-
-==============================================================
-= NOTE 2: The item_descriptions.txt file that comes with this
-=         package has incorrect and blank entries. Please make
-=         sure to go over all the descriptions if you plan on
-=         using it to generate description files for your
-=         server's data folder.

-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: You're missing
-the cygwin
-dlls. Please get the latest dll at: http://www.cygwin.com/snapshot. If
-you're unsure, asking around in our IRC chatroom will get you around
-too, but always remember - use common sense and search before asking.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My map-server
-won't load! It
-appears to be loading things before it dissapeared suddenly! HELP!<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Use command line
-to load
-map-server. It should tell you the error. If you're missing a map,
-update your kRO Sakray or comment the map from map_athena.conf. If you
-have an errornous NPC, fix it or comment it off. Anything other than
-that, feel free to ask around.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My map-server
-failed to load
-'adata.grf'! Where do I find this adata.grf? My map-server won't load
-without it!<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: The error that
-caused the
-map-server to not load is not the adata.grf. adata.grf is NOT a
-requirement for the map-server to load. The error is probably related
-to something else.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: All 3 of the
-servers are
-loaded, but I am still having problems accessing it! What do I do?<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: First, check the
-IPs in
-map_athena.conf and char_athena.conf. If those are correct, check the
-ports to make sure they match. If that's correct too, you probably
-cannot handle the server load. Lower the monster spawning rate using
-mob_count in battle_athena.conf and it should be fine.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: How do I start
-Guild
-Wars/War of Emperium??? HELP!!!<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Read the GM
-Command page for
-full list of commands that GMs can use, including the command for this.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: My Ragnarok
-Online crashed
-while playing with eAthena! What do I do now?<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Well, if your
-Ragnarok
-crashes, it's most probably not anything to do with eAthena. Something
-is wrong with your Ragnarok installation. Try reinstalling or updating.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: Is eAthena
-compatible with
-mySQL? Can I use mySQL as the DB instead of using text files?<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Yes, eAthena is
-compatible
-with mySQL. A tutorial on how to setup this is coming soon.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: Is eAthena
-compatible with
-msSQL? Can I use msSQL as the DB instead of using text files?<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: No, eAthena is
-not
-compatible with msSQL. You cannot use msSQL with eAthena.<br>
-            <br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Q</span>: I found a bug!
-Where do I
-report it?<br>
-            <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>: Drop the

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-== Spell language
-
-* Comments: One-line comments using '#' or '//' as prefix
-* names vs. invocations:  spells and anchors have both names
-  and invocations.  Names are used to refer to spells and
-  anchors from within scripts without revealing their
-  invocations.
-
-
-Each spell specification file consists of a sequence of definitions of
-globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.
-
-Types:
-------
-  These are the primitive types:
-  * int
-  * string
-  * dir	       (a direction: N, S, SE, NW etc.)
-  * location   (a single spot in the world)
-  * entity     (a PC, NPC, or monster)
-  * area       (a set of locations)
-  * spell      (a spell)
-  * invocation (a spell instance)
-  * fail       (a separate type that arises implicitly when a function
-    	        fails)
-
-  `fail' arises in special circumstances in some functions, e.g. when
-trying to divide by zero, or when function parameters fail to
-type-check.  When a fail value flows into an operation, than that
-operation is skipped.  When a fail value flows into a function, then
-that function evaluates to fail, except for
-
-  * if_then_else (which permits `fail' in its true or false branch)
-  * failed (which returns true iff the argument is of type fail).
-
-  We will use standard functional type notation:
-
-  `int * string -> entity' denotes the type of a function that accepts
-an integer and a string and returns an entity.  We use the return `()'
-for operations (which return nothing).
-
-Globals:
---------
-  A `global' is a global variable, declared and defined in the
-same line:
-
-	foo = "this is a string";
-
-  Expressions can be arbitrary language expressions.  Note that globals
-can only reference the values of globals defined earlier in the same
-program.
-
-  There are two special globals:
-
-  * min_casttime : int
-    Minimal number of milliseconds of cast delay, no matter what any
-    given spell may say.  Cast delay is the time before the next spell
-    can be cast.
-
-  * obscure : int
-    Chance of a character of a given spell to be obscured (masked out
-    by an asterisk).
-
-
-  Globals can also be defined as CONST (though this should not be done
-for the special globals listed above or they will not take effect.)
-CONST-defined globals cannot be re-defined.
-
-
-Expressions:
-------------
-  Expressions occur in globals, anchors, spells, and procedures.
-Expressions evaluate to values of a given type.  Expressions can be
-simple literals, area literals, infix expressions, function
-applications, or variable refecences.
-
-- Simple literals:
-  * 42, 0xff: int literals
-  * N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW : dir literals
-  * "foo bar" : string literals
-
-- Area literals:
-  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26)
-    This area denotes a single field on a map (new_3-1.gat,
-    co-ordinates (26,26).
-  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+ (10, 10) 
-    This area is 100 fields, stretching to a field of size 10x10 to
-    the south and east of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.
-  * @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) towards S (5, 3)
-    This area is a rectangular field of depth 3 and width 5 to the
-    south of (26,26) in new_3-1.gat.  `depth 3' here means that it
-    stretches three fields to the south.  `width 5' here means that it
-    extends five fields to the east and five to the west of the
-    specified coordinate, for a total width of 11.
-    The only directions supported here are S, E, N, W.
-
-- Infix expressions:
-  Infix expressions are special functions in which the operator is
-  written between two expressions.  Infix expressions largely follow
-  the C precedence rules.  The following infix operators are
-  supported:
-  * addition (+) (operates on ints, concatenates strings, and
-    	     	  constructs the union of areas)
-  * subtraction (- : int * int -> int)
-  * multiplication (* : int * int -> int)
-  * division (/ : int * int -> int, may fail)
-  * modulo (% : int * int -> int, may fail)
-  * comparison (<, >, >=, <=, =, <> : int * int -> int)
-    Comparison operators generally work on ints and strings.
-    (In)equality checks work on all values except for areas.
-    Note that "==" and "!=" are available as alternatives for "=" and
-    "<>" (respectively).
-  * conjunction and disjunction (&&, || : int * int -> int).  Note
-    that these are not short-circuit.
-  * Bitwise or (| : int * int -> int)
-  * Bitwise and (& : int * int -> int)
-  * Bitwise xor (^ : int * int -> int)
-  * Shift left and right (<<, >> : int * int -> int)
-
-- Function applications:
-  Function applications are written as
-
-    f(arg1, ..., argn)
-
-  where each `argi' is an arbitrary expression.
-  For a complete list of Functions, see `functions' below.
-
-- Variable references:
-  The expression (foo + 1) references a variable `foo' which must have
-  been previously defined.
-
-
-Anchors:
---------
-  Anchors are teleport anchors; spells can look them up by name.  Each
-teleport anchor is written as
-
-    TELEPORT-ANCHOR <id> : <invocation-string> = <location>
-
-  For example:
-
-    TELEPORT-ANCHOR tulimshar : "home" = @("new_3-1.gat", 26, 26) @+(10, 10) 
-
-  This maps the teleport anchor `tulimshar' to an area in new_3-1.gat
-binds it to the name "home".  The function `anchor' can look up
-teleport anchors (cf. the function library).
-
-
-Spells:
--------
-  Each spell is written either as
-
-    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> : <name> = <spelldef>
-
-  or as
-
-    [spell-modifiers] SPELL <id> (<id> : <sty>) : <name> = <spelldef>
-
-  For example,
-
-    SPELL random_dance : "zxr" = ...
-
-  creates a spell `random_dance' and makes it available under the
-invocation "zxr".  The string `...' is not a valid <spelldef>; we will
-look at proper spelldefs below.  An alternative example illustrates
-the use of parameters:
-
-    SPELL shout (message : STRING) : "zzx" = ...
-
-  This defines a spell `shout' (bound to invocation "zzx") that takes
-a parameter `message' of type STRING.  Valid types are STRING and PC:
-PC parameters are automatically translated into a player character
-entity of that name, or mapped to the caster if the specified name
-does not map to a player character or is missing.
-
-  The list of spell modifiers is short:
-
-  * SILENT means that the spell's invocation will never be broadcast,
-    	   not even obscured.
-  * LOCAL means that the spell is bound to the location it was cast at
-    	  and will not `travel' with the caster.
-  * NONMAGIC means that the spell is not affected by the caster's ability
-          to perform magic.  Typically used for special (quest) keywords.
-
-  Modifiers may be given in any order, but only once.
-
-- Spell bodies
-
-  Spell bodies consist of three parts: LET bindings, spell guards and
-  effects.  LET bindings locally bind names to values.  Spell guards
-  are constraints that must be satisfied for the spell to be
-  triggered.  Effects describes what happens if the spell is
-  successfully triggered.  Spells may have multiple guards and
-  effects.
-
-  Consider the following example:
-
-    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
-          LET x = "kappa"
-              y = "sigma"
-          IN
-          (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) => EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
-        | (MANA 20) => EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch")
-
-  This defines a spell `plugh' with two let bindings (`x' bound to
-  "kappa" and `y' bound to "sigma") and two `branches' which are
-  tested in sequence.  The first branch tests whether the caster has
-  one spellpoint and owns a pearl-- if so, the effect of sending a
-  message "First branch" to the caster is triggered.
-
-  However, if the spell guard is not satisfied, the magic engine
-  examines the second branch.  Now, if the caster has 20 spellpoints,
-  we INSTEAD trigger the effect of sending the message "Second branch"
-  to the caster.
-
-- Spell guards
-
-  Spell guards can be omitted; in that case, just use the effect
-  itself.  Otherwise they can be any of the following:
-  * MANA x:  Require x spellpoints to be present.  If this spellguard
-    is taken, x mana will be consumed implicitly.  This requirement is
-    cumulative.
-  * CASTTIME x:  Require that the caster spend x milliseconds until
-    the next spell can be cast.  This requirement is cumulative.  If
-    the total casttime for a spell is less than the global variable
-    min_casttime, then the latter supercedes the specified spell cast
-    delay.
-  * REQUIRE <expr>:  Test that the specified expression evaluates to
-    nonzero and does not fail.  Requirements are cumulative.
-  * CATALYSTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
-    items.  This effect is cumulative.
-  * COMPONENTS <items>: Ensure that the caster possesses all specified
-    items.  If the branch suceeeds, all items specified here are
-    consumed.  This effect is cumulative.
-
-  Items can be specified as follows:
-  * [ 700, 701 ]	-- require one item of item ID 700 and one of 701.
-  * [ 700, 3 * 701 ]	-- require 1 item of item ID 700 and 3 of 701.
-  * [ "Pearl" ]		-- require one item named `Pearl' in the item DB.
-
-  Spell guards can be combined as follows:
-  * `or': disjunction.  The first matching path is taken.
-  * (a, ..., n): conjunction.  a, n, and everything in between must be
-    satisfied.
-  * a => b:  Implication.  If `a' is satisfied, try to satisfy `b'.
-    This operation is useful to combine different branches (see
-    below.)
-
-  Different branches of spell effects are separated by the vertical
-  bar `|'.  For example,
-
-    SPELL plugh (message : STRING) : "zzx" =
-        MANA 5 => (  (CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
-                            EFFECT message (caster, "First branch");
-                   | (MANA 20) =>
-                            EFFECT message (caster, "Second branch");)
-
-  will always try to deduct 5 Mana points but then make a choice of
-  whether to go to the first branch (if the player has `Pearl') or to
-  the second (if the player does not have `Pear' but has another 20
-  spell points, for a total of 25 spell points, all of which will be
-  consumed in that case.)
-
-
-- Effects
-
-  Effects describe what happens when a spell is triggered.  Each
-  spell has at least one EFFECT specification, which looks as follows:
-
-    EFFECT <effectlist> [ ATTRIGGER <effectlist> ] [ ATEND <effectlist> ]
-
-  The three parts are as follows:
-  * EFFECT:  All effects here are executed as soon as the spell is
-    triggered.
-  * ATEND:  All steps described here are executed when the spell
-    finishes.   Note that the spell may remain active after all steps
-    from the EFFECT section have been taken; this happens when the spell
-    triggers a status change (using the `status_change' operation,
-    as described in the operations library).  In that case the spell
-    will terminate only after all status changes have finished.
-    The ATEND section is not called when the spell finishes due to the
-    caster dying.
-  * ATTRIGGER:  This section is used only for the `override_attack'
-    operation and described there.
-
-  Before effects are executed, the engine defines the following
-  variables:
-
-  * The parameter (if any)
-  * caster : entity (the caster of this spell)
-  * spellpower : int (the caster's spellpower, normally 6 -- 198)
-  * location : location (the location the spell is currently at)
-  * self_spell : spell (the current spell)
-  * self_invocation : invocation (the current spell instance)
-
-  The engine can then execute the following effects from the effect list:
-  * SKIP;	    #  a no-op
-  * ABORT;	    #  Abort the spell, don't run ATEND, don't consume a
-    		    #    trigger charge (cf. `override_attack')
-  * END;	    #  Skip to the ATEND block
-  * WAIT <expr>;    #  Wait <expr> milliseconds before continuing
-  * <id> = <expr>;  #  Set <id> to the result of evaluating <expr>
-  * (<s1> ... <sn>) #  Execute statements <s1> through <sn> in sequence
-  * IF <c>	    #  Test condition <c>.  If nonzero,
-    THEN <s1>	    #    execute <s1>.  Otherwise,
-    ELSE <s2> 	    #    execute <s2>.
-                    #    The `ELSE' branch can be omitted.
-
-  * FOREACH <k> <id> IN <expr> DO <s>
-                    # Evaluate <expr> to an area, find all entities in
-		    #   the area that match <k>, randomise this list,
-		    #   bind <id> to each in turn and execute <s>.
-
-    Example:
-
-    FOREACH ENTITY t IN rbox(location(caster), 20)
-      DO aggravate(t, 0, caster);
-      	 	    # This aggravates all entities within 20 paces of
-		    #   the caster to attack the caster.
-
-    Valid values for <k> are
-    + ENTITY : PC or mob
-    + PC
-    + MOB
-    + TARGET : mob, PC (but only if we are on a PvP map)
-
-  * FOR <id> = <start> TO <stop> DO <stmt>
-    # This will iterate from <start> to <stop> (inclusively), bind
-    # <id> to the current iteration value, and execute <stmt>.
-
-  * BREAK;
-    # This will break out of the current FOR loop, FOREACH loop, or
-    # procedure.
-
-  * <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
-    # This executes an operation.  See `Operations', below, for a
-    # list.
-
-  * CALL <id> ( <expr1>,  ..., <exprn> );
-    # This will execute a procedure, after binding the actual
-    # parameters from <expr1> to <exprn> to the formal procedure
-    # parameters.
-
-  * { ... }
-    # This executes arbitrary eAthena script code.  The following
-    # variables script variables are bound implicitly:
-    # - @caster_name$ is the name of the spellcaster
-    # - @caster and @target are also bound, to useless values (sorry.)
-    #
-    # By default, script popup boxes are sent to the caster.  This can
-    # be overridden by setting the special `script_target' variable.
-
-Procedures:
------------
-  Procedures are defined as
-
-    PROCEDURE <id> ( <id>, ... , <id> ) = <effectlist>
-
-  For example,
-
-    PROCEDURE testproc(x) = message(caster, "foo(" + x + )");
-                            y = 10;
-                            x = 20;
-
-  defines a procedure `testproc' with one formal parameter `x'.
-  Procedure execution is nonrecursive and uses dynamic scoping.  The
-  latter means that it can modify variables in the caller's scope.  In
-  the above example, the assignment to `y' will be visible to the
-  caller.  The assignment to `x' however will be not be visible, since
-  that assignment goes to the parameter and is therefore limited in
-  scope to `testproc'.  More precisely,
-
-      EFFECT x = 0; y = 0; testproc(1);
-      	     message(caster, "x=" + x + ", y=" + y);
-
-  would print
-
-      foo(1)
-      x=0, y=10
-
-  (note how the update to x is isolated from the caller.)

-
-  + substr : string * int * int -> string

-
-Operations:
------------
-This section documents the operations API.
-
-  + sfx : entity * int * int -> ()
-        | location * int *int -> ()
-    Trigger a special effect (specified by sfx ID) for an entity or a
-    location.  The int specifies a delay until the effect is issued.
-
-  + itemheal : entity * int * int -> ()
-    itemheal(entity, hp, sp) triggers item healing.  This will
-    hopefully be slowed down if an appropriate server patch is
-    installed.
-
-  + instaheal : entity * int * int -> ()
-    itemheal(entity, hp, sp) heals instantly.
-
-  + shroud : entity * int -> ()
-    shroud(entity, flags) hides the entity's name (only for PCs).
-    Flags:  0x01: Hide PC'ss name when talking
-            0x02: Shroud vanishes when player picks something up
-            0x04: Shroud vanishes when player talks
-    The shroud will not affect players in visible range until the
-    entity has left and re-entered their field of vision.  This can be
-    enforced by warping.
-
-  + unshroud : entity -> ()
-    Counter a shroud.
-
-  + message : entity * string -> ()
-    Send a message to the entity.
-
-  + messenger_npc : location * int
-                    * string * string * int -> ()
-    messenger_npc(location, image, npc_name, message, duration)
-    creates a messenger NPC looking like the `image' at `location',
-    with name `npc_name' and delivering the `message' when clicked
-    upon.  The NPC disappears after the `duration' in ms has expired.
-
-  + move : entity * dir -> ()
-    Move the entity into the specified direction, unless that
-    direction is blocked.
-
-  + warp : entity * location -> ()
-    Warp entity to specified location.
-
-  + spawn : area * entity * int * int * int * int -> ()
-    spawn(area, owner, mob_id, attitude, count, lifetime) spawns for a
-    limited `lifetime' (in ms) a total of `count' monsters of kind
-    `mob_id' in `area'.  `attitude' specifies how they behave:
-      0 : attack everyone
-      1 : be friendly
-      2 : attack enemies of `owner' and give XP to `owner' if successful
-
-  + banish : entity -> ()
-    If the entity was spawned by the `spawn' operation, eliminate it.
-
-
-  + status_change : entity * int * int
-                    * int * int * int * int -> ()
-    status_change(entity, status, v1, v2, v3, v4, duration) initiates
-    a status change.  The precise status change (and the meaning of
-    `v1', `v2', `v3', `v4') varies depending on `status'.  This
-    operation may delay spell termination (and the ATEND effect).
-    ATEND can therefore be used to notify the caster that the status
-    change has finished.
-
-  + stop_status_change : entity * int
-    Stops a status change
-
-  + override_attack : entity * int * int
-                             * int * int *int * int -> ()
-    override_attack(entity, charges, delay, range, icon, animation, stop)
-    overrides the entity's current attack (only for PCs).  The entity
-    will have `charges' attacks that instead result in calling the
-    ATTRIGGER effect for this spell.  When this operation is called,
-    the spell environment (variables etc.) is cloned into a separate
-    invocation.  This special invocation will be triggered every time
-    the entity tries to attack, until they have run out of charages (at
-    which time the previous behaviour is restored.)
-    `delay' specifies the attack delay.
-    `range' specifies the attack range as shown in the client GUI.
-    `icon' is the ID of a status-effect ID that will be displayed
-    while the spell is in effect.
-    `animation' is the attack animation ID that should be used.
-    `stop' decides whether attacking should stop once the spell is out
-    of charges (1) or continue (0). (Note: this doesn't properly work,
-    possibly due to client issues.  Always use 0.)
-
-    Note that if the ATTRIGGER effect ABORTs, no charge will be
-    consumed.
-
-    ATTRIGGER can refernece the player's target via the `target'
-    variable.
-
-    Example:
-
-    SPELL tshuffle : "zvp" =
-        (MANA 1, CATALYSTS ["Pearl"]) =>
-        EFFECT
-                override_attack(caster, 3, 500, 10, 700, 31);
-        ATTRIGGER
-                IF (not (line_of_sight(location, location(target))))
-                THEN (message (caster, "No line of sight!"); ABORT;)
-                FOR i = 0 TO 10 DO (move(target, random_dir(0)););
-
-    This overrides the caster's attack for three attacks (attack delay
-    500, range 10) to instead randomly move around any entity that the
-    player tries to attack by up to 11 paces.
-
-  + create_item : entity * int * int -> ()
-                | entity * string * int -> ()
-    create_item(entity, item, count) gives the `entity' `count'
-    instances of `item'.  As usual, `item' can be either a string name
-    or an item ID.
-
-  + aggravate : entity * int * entity -> ()
-    aggravate (victim, mode, target) causes the `victim' to
-      mode = 0: attack `target'
-      mode = 1: become universally permanently aggressive
-      mode = 2: both of the above
-
-  + injure : entity * entity * int * int -> ()
-    injure(attacker, defender, hp, sp) causes damage to the defender
-    from the attacker (possibly killing, giving XP etc.), unless the
-    defender is immortal (NPC) or a PC on a non-PvP map.
-
-  + emote : entity * int -> ()
-    Issues the specified emotion to the specified entity.
-
-  + set_script_variable : entity * string * int -> ()
-    Sets a script variable to the specified value
-
-  + set_hair_colour : entity * int -> ()
-    Sets the hair colour of the specified entity to the specified
-    value (must be a PC).
-
-  + set_hair_style : entity * int -> ()
-    Adjusts the hair style of a PC.
-
-  + drop_item : location * (int | string) * int * int -> ()
-    drop_item(place, "name", count, duration) drops `count' items
-    (where count may be zero) of name "name" at `place'.  The items
-    vanish again after `duration'.
-
-  + drop_item_for : location * (int | string)
-                    * int * int * entity * int -> ()
-    drop_item_for(place, obj, count, duration, owner, delay) works
-    like drop_item(place, obj, count, duration), except that the item
-    can only be picked up by `owner' for the next `delay'
-    milliseconds, modulo pickup rules (spousal pickup, out-of-range).
-
-  + gain_experience : entity * int * int * int -> ()
-    gain_experience(player, base_xp, job_xp, reason) gives expereince
-    points to `player'.  If reason is 0, they are handed out normally,
-    but if reason is 1, then those experience points are NOT added to
-    the pool of experience points that healers can draw from `player'.
-
-  + resurrect : entity * int * int * int -> ()
-    resurrect(player, regenerated_hp, regenerated_sp, flag) resurrect
-    `player'.  If flag is 0, regenerated_hp and regenerated_sp are
-    percentage of the maximum value but if flag is 1, then those 
-    values are the real hp and sp that will be assigned to `player'.
-
-
-
-Script API updates:

-Two new script API functions are available:
-
-  * getspellinvocation : string -> string
-    Looks up a spell by spell ID and returns the spell's invocation.
-  * getanchorinvocation : string -> string
-    Looks up a teleport anchor by anchor ID and returns the invocation.
